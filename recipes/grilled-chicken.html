      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Don't use a stainless steel bowl for preparing marinade.</p>

      <p>You can also serve chicken without using skewers.</p>

      <p>If sauce has not thickened to desired consistency, boil a little longer and add more cornstarch. If it's too thick,
        add a little water.</p>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Slice chicken in half lengthwise to get thin pieces. Prick lightly using a fork or a knife to help tenderize.</li>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, fish sauce, and lime juice in a large bowl, resealable plastic container, or large zip-top bag. Add chicken tenders, making sure marinade fully covers chicken. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade and thread onto metal skewers.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add marinade to a small saucepan with cornstarch and bring to a boil. Boil until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off heat and transfer sauce to a small bowl for dipping.</li>
        <li>Grill skewers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the centers, about 5 minutes per side. Garnish with scallion and serve with sauce on the side.</li>
      </ol>
